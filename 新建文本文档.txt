It is also very important to note the introduction of the principle of nondiscrimination through the adoption of the most-favored-nation clause, which could be disallowed in the case of existing preferential trading systems, future trade unions (think of the European Community), and free trade associations. One has also to note the ¡°unselfish¡± leadership of the U.S. which accepted de facto significant discrimination against its own products, among others encouraging the creation of the European Economic Community and Japanese protectionism. It was a Wilsonian vision: a world more open to trade is more inclined toward peace. 6 It was a vision which emanated from American elites and was neither shared nor resisted by the masses, in light of the small importance of the international sector in the U.S. economy at the time.
